# Portfolio-demosite
Designed and developed a personal portfolio website to showcase projects, skills, and contact information using only HTML and CSS.

Created a clean, responsive layout optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using modern CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid.

Implemented smooth navigation, project cards, and interactive hover effects to enhance user experience.

Focused on minimalist, user-friendly design with an emphasis on readability and visual hierarchy.

Structured the site for easy scalability and future integration of JavaScript or backend functionality.
